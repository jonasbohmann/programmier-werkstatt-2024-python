::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Define a function that takes parameters.
- Return a value from a function.
- Test and debug a function.
- Set default values for function parameters.
- Explain why we should divide programs into small, single-purpose functions.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can I define new functions?
- What's the difference between defining and calling a function?
- What happens when I call a function?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

At this point, we've seen that code can have Python make decisions about what it sees in our data. What if we want to convert some of our data, like taking a temperature in Fahrenheit and converting it to Celsius. We could write something like this for converting a single number

```python
fahrenheit_val = 99
celsius_val = ((fahrenheit_val - 32) * (5/9))
```

and for a second number we could just copy the line and rename the variables

```python
fahrenheit_val = 99
celsius_val = ((fahrenheit_val - 32) * (5/9))

fahrenheit_val2 = 43
celsius_val2 = ((fahrenheit_val2 - 32) * (5/9))
```

But we would be in trouble as soon as we had to do this more than a couple times.
Cutting and pasting it is going to make our code get very long and very repetitive,
very quickly.
We'd like a way to package our code so that it is easier to reuse,
a shorthand way of re-executing longer pieces of code. In Python we can use 'functions'.
Let's start by defining a function `fahr_to_celsius` that converts temperatures
from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

```python
def explicit_fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    # Assign the converted value to a variable
    converted = ((temp - 32) * (5/9))
    # Return the value of the new variable
    return converted
    
def fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    # Return converted value more efficiently using the return
    # function without creating a new variable. This code does
    # the same thing as the previous function but it is more explicit
    # in explaining how the return command works.
    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))
```

![](fig/python-function.svg){alt='Labeled parts of a Python function definition'}

The function definition opens with the keyword `def` followed by the
name of the function (`fahr_to_celsius`) and a parenthesized list of parameter names (`temp`). The
[body](../learners/reference.md#body) of the function --- the
statements that are executed when it runs --- is indented below the
definition line.  The body concludes with a `return` keyword followed by the return value.

When we call the function,
the values we pass to it are assigned to those variables
so that we can use them inside the function.
Inside the function,
we use a [return statement](../learners/reference.md#return-statement) to send a result
back to whoever asked for it.

Let's try running our function.

```python
fahr_to_celsius(32)
```

This command should call our function, using "32" as the input and return the function value.

In fact, calling our own function is no different from calling any other function:

```python
print('freezing point of water:', fahr_to_celsius(32), 'C')
print('boiling point of water:', fahr_to_celsius(212), 'C')
```

```output
freezing point of water: 0.0 C
boiling point of water: 100.0 C
```

We've successfully called the function that we defined,
and we have access to the value that we returned.

## Composing Functions

Now that we've seen how to turn Fahrenheit into Celsius,
we can also write the function to turn Celsius into Kelvin:

```python
def celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c):
    return temp_c + 273.15

print('freezing point of water in Kelvin:', celsius_to_kelvin(0.))
```

```output
freezing point of water in Kelvin: 273.15
```

What about converting Fahrenheit to Kelvin?
We could write out the formula,
but we don't need to.
Instead,
we can [compose](../learners/reference.md#compose) the two functions we have already created:

```python
def fahr_to_kelvin(temp_f):
    temp_c = fahr_to_celsius(temp_f)
    temp_k = celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c)
    return temp_k

print('boiling point of water in Kelvin:', fahr_to_kelvin(212.0))
```

```output
boiling point of water in Kelvin: 373.15
```

This is our first taste of how larger programs are built:
we define basic operations,
then combine them in ever-larger chunks to get the effect we want.
Real-life functions will usually be larger than the ones shown here --- typically half a dozen
to a few dozen lines --- but they shouldn't ever be much longer than that,
or the next person who reads it won't be able to understand what's going on.

## Variable Scope

In composing our temperature conversion functions, we created variables inside of those functions,
`temp`, `temp_c`, `temp_f`, and `temp_k`.
We refer to these variables as [local variables](../learners/reference.md#local-variable)
because they no longer exist once the function is done executing.
If we try to access their values outside of the function, we will encounter an error:

```python
print('Again, temperature in Kelvin was:', temp_k)
```

```error
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-eed2471d229b> in <module>
----> 1 print('Again, temperature in Kelvin was:', temp_k)

NameError: name 'temp_k' is not defined
```

If you want to reuse the temperature in Kelvin after you have calculated it with `fahr_to_kelvin`,
you can store the result of the function call in a variable:

```python
temp_kelvin = fahr_to_kelvin(212.0)
print('temperature in Kelvin was:', temp_kelvin)
```

```output
temperature in Kelvin was: 373.15
```

The variable `temp_kelvin`, being defined outside any function,
is said to be [global](../learners/reference.md#global-variable).

Inside a function, one can read the value of such global variables:

```python
def print_temperatures():
    print('temperature in Fahrenheit was:', temp_fahr)
    print('temperature in Kelvin was:', temp_kelvin)

temp_fahr = 212.0
temp_kelvin = fahr_to_kelvin(temp_fahr)

print_temperatures()
```

```output
temperature in Fahrenheit was: 212.0
temperature in Kelvin was: 373.15
```

## Readable functions

Consider these two functions:

```python
def s(p):
    a = 0
    for v in p:
        a += v
    m = a / len(p)
    d = 0
    for v in p:
        d += (v - m) * (v - m)
    return numpy.sqrt(d / (len(p) - 1))

def std_dev(sample):
    sample_sum = 0
    for value in sample:
        sample_sum += value

    sample_mean = sample_sum / len(sample)

    sum_squared_devs = 0
    for value in sample:
        sum_squared_devs += (value - sample_mean) * (value - sample_mean)

    return numpy.sqrt(sum_squared_devs / (len(sample) - 1))
```

The functions `s` and `std_dev` are computationally equivalent (they
both calculate the sample standard deviation), but to a human reader,
they look very different. You probably found `std_dev` much easier to
read and understand than `s`.

As this example illustrates, both documentation and a programmer's
*coding style* combine to determine how easy it is for others to read
and understand the programmer's code. Choosing meaningful variable
names and using blank spaces to break the code into logical "chunks"
are helpful techniques for producing *readable code*. This is useful
not only for sharing code with others, but also for the original
programmer. If you need to revisit code that you wrote months ago and
haven't thought about since then, you will appreciate the value of
readable code!

## Combining Strings

"Adding" two strings produces their concatenation:
`'a' + 'b'` is `'ab'`.
Write a function called `fence` that takes two parameters called `original` and `wrapper`
and returns a new string that has the wrapper character at the beginning and end of the original.
A call to your function should look like this:

```python
print(fence('name', '*'))
```

```output
*name*
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```python
def fence(original, wrapper):
    return wrapper + original + wrapper
```

## Return versus print

Note that `return` and `print` are not interchangeable.
`print` is a Python function that *prints* data to the screen.
It enables us, *users*, see the data.
`return` statement, on the other hand, makes data visible to the program.
Let's have a look at the following function:

```python
def add(a, b):
    print(a + b)
```

**Question**: What will we see if we execute the following commands?

```python
A = add(7, 3)
print(A)
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Python will first execute the function `add` with `a = 7` and `b = 3`,
and, therefore, print `10`. However, because function `add` does not have a
line that starts with `return` (no `return` "statement"), it will, by default, return
nothing which, in Python world, is called `None`. Therefore, `A` will be assigned to `None`
and the last line (`print(A)`) will print `None`. As a result, we will see:

```output
10
None
```

## Selecting Characters From Strings

If the variable `s` refers to a string,
then `s[0]` is the string's first character
and `s[-1]` is its last.
Write a function called `outer`
that returns a string made up of just the first and last characters of its input.
A call to your function should look like this:

```python
print(outer('helium'))
```

```output
hm
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```python
def outer(input_string):
    return input_string[0] + input_string[-1]
```

## Rescaling an Array

Write a function `rescale` that takes an array as input
and returns a corresponding array of values scaled to lie in the range 0.0 to 1.0.
(Hint: If `L` and `H` are the lowest and highest values in the original array,
then the replacement for a value `v` should be `(v-L) / (H-L)`.)

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```python
def rescale(input_array):
    L = numpy.amin(input_array)
    H = numpy.amax(input_array)
    output_array = (input_array - L) / (H - L)
    return output_array
```

## Testing and Documenting Your Function

Run the commands `help(numpy.arange)` and `help(numpy.linspace)`
to see how to use these functions to generate regularly-spaced values,
then use those values to test your `rescale` function.
Once you've successfully tested your function,
add a docstring that explains what it does.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```python
"""Takes an array as input, and returns a corresponding array scaled so
that 0 corresponds to the minimum and 1 to the maximum value of the input array.

Examples:
>>> rescale(numpy.arange(10.0))
array([ 0.        ,  0.11111111,  0.22222222,  0.33333333,  0.44444444,
       0.55555556,  0.66666667,  0.77777778,  0.88888889,  1.        ])
>>> rescale(numpy.linspace(0, 100, 5))
array([ 0.  ,  0.25,  0.5 ,  0.75,  1.  ])
"""
```

## Defining Defaults

Rewrite the `rescale` function so that it scales data to lie between `0.0` and `1.0` by default,
but will allow the caller to specify lower and upper bounds if they want.
Compare your implementation to your neighbor's:
do the two functions always behave the same way?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```python
def rescale(input_array, low_val=0.0, high_val=1.0):
    """rescales input array values to lie between low_val and high_val"""
    L = numpy.amin(input_array)
    H = numpy.amax(input_array)
    intermed_array = (input_array - L) / (H - L)
    output_array = intermed_array * (high_val - low_val) + low_val
    return output_array
```

## Variables Inside and Outside Functions

What does the following piece of code display when run --- and why?

```python
f = 0
k = 0

def f2k(f):
    k = ((f - 32) * (5.0 / 9.0)) + 273.15
    return k

print(f2k(8))
print(f2k(41))
print(f2k(32))

print(k)
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```output
259.81666666666666
278.15
273.15
0
```

`k` is 0 because the `k` inside the function `f2k` doesn't know
about the `k` defined outside the function. When the `f2k` function is called,
it creates a [local variable](../learners/reference.md#local-variable)
`k`. The function does not return any values
and does not alter `k` outside of its local copy.
Therefore the original value of `k` remains unchanged.
Beware that a local `k` is created because `f2k` internal statements
*affect* a new value to it. If `k` was only `read`, it would simply retrieve the
global `k` value.

## Mixing Default and Non-Default Parameters

Given the following code:

```python
def numbers(one, two=2, three, four=4):
    n = str(one) + str(two) + str(three) + str(four)
    return n

print(numbers(1, three=3))
```

what do you expect will be printed?  What is actually printed?
What rule do you think Python is following?

1. `1234`
2. `one2three4`
3. `1239`
4. `SyntaxError`

Given that, what does the following piece of code display when run?

```python
def func(a, b=3, c=6):
    print('a: ', a, 'b: ', b, 'c:', c)

func(-1, 2)
```

1. `a: b: 3 c: 6`
2. `a: -1 b: 3 c: 6`
3. `a: -1 b: 2 c: 6`
4. `a: b: -1 c: 2`

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Attempting to define the `numbers` function results in `4. SyntaxError`.
The defined parameters `two` and `four` are given default values. Because
`one` and `three` are not given default values, they are required to be
included as arguments when the function is called and must be placed
before any parameters that have default values in the function definition.

The given call to `func` displays `a: -1 b: 2 c: 6`. -1 is assigned to
the first parameter `a`, 2 is assigned to the next parameter `b`, and `c` is
not passed a value, so it uses its default value 6.

Revise a function you wrote for one of the previous exercises to try to make
the code more readable. Then, collaborate with one of your neighbors
to critique each other's functions and discuss how your function implementations
could be further improved to make them more readable.
